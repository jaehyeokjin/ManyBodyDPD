# Organization
1. Parametrization: Two-step serial parametrization for conservative interactions
2. Time-Correlation: Obtaining the time-correlation for VV, FV, need to infer the kernels
3. Propagation in MDPD, NMDPD is conducted using the code associated with the trajectories
4. Analysis: RDF, Density, Cvv (lagtime), Integrating Cvv to get D(t)
