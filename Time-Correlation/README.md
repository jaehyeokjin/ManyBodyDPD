# Time Correlation Analysis

This repository contains codes and tools for time correlation analysis using Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) techniques and sparse analysis for mapping finer-resolution trajectories.

## Folder Structure

### 1. GLE-folder
This folder contains GLE code used to determine the friction kernel. We have adapted the **FitGLE** code from the original repository.

### 2. scratch-sparse
This folder contains the analysis code for time correlation. It provides the files needed to map trajectories at finer resolutions. Note that the trajectory data itself is archived due to its large volume.
